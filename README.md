This is the second version of a Rock Paper Scissors program i wrote a while back.
It currently work only if you download the whole project becouse executable jars wont load images (even if it's still playable).
At the moment i've spent 6 hours trying to get it to work in a jar with no result.
I surrender and i'm uploading it here on github.
